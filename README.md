### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a new directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   When activated, your terminal prompt will change to indicate you are now working inside the virtual environment.

### Install Dependencies

Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt` to set up your environment with the necessary libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the dependencies specified in it.

### Running Program

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**
